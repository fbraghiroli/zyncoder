zynmidirouter description
=========================

zynmidirouter is a core module. It provides routing, filtering and translation of MIDI messages.

JACK MIDI input ports
=====================

dev0..dev15: For physical MIDI port connections, one per physical port - also TouchOSC
net: Connection from MIDI over network protocols, e.g. QmidiNet, jackrtpmidi (not RtMidiOut (TouchOSC)) (why is this special?)
seq: For Standard MIDI File (SMF) player (why is this special?)
step: For step sequencer (why is this special?)
ctrl: Control feedback from engines

JACK MIDI output ports
======================
ch0..ch15: Connection to each chain
main: MIDI recorder, engines not in chains 
midi: Hardware MIDI outputs + ZynMaster (what is this?)
net: MIDI over network protocols, e.g. QmidiNet, rtpmidi
ctrl: MIDI outputs configured as feedback ports
step: Connection to step sequencer

Virtual MIDI inputs
===================
int: Internal MIDI messages
ui: Messages triggered by user interface
ctrl_fb:

Virtual MIDI outputs
====================
zynmidi: Messages targetted at user interface

Note: Virtual input and output queues are normalised and limited to 3 byte messages.

Input processing
================

Each MIDI message received on a physical input is processed in the order they are received. Messages from virtual sources are processed and despatched last. After each mesage is processed it is routed to the appropriate outputs and duplicated as necessary based on rules such as channel cloning.

The input processing stage performs these processes:

- Drop Active Sense and SysEx messages
- Transform to active channel (only if active channel enabled)
- Capture message from UI before further processing (only if MIDI learn enabled)
- Apply MIDI filter:
  - Drop ignored events
  - Map prog change, channel pressure, pitch bend, CC, etc.
- Capture message for "Master Channel"
- Process CC for absolute / relative modes
- Filter for note range
- Transpose
- Capture message from UI after processing (only if not already captured before processing)
- Despatch message to UI (if appropriate)
- Map CC (swap CC number as defined in input filter)

Output processing
=================

After each MIDI event is processed by the input filtering and translation stage it is sent to the outputs defined by configuration rules. The folloing processing is applied to each output:

- Filter on MIDI channel
- Translate MIDI if configured
- Addition of pitchbend message if fine tuning enabled (currently a global configuration but could be per output)
